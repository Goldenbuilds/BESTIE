### This is a list of libraries used in the program and their use in the program(I am still updating this!)

\*\*Note that the python version used for this program was python 3.12 on a windows 10 64 bits computer.

1. **sapi5**

SAPI 5 (Speech Application Programming Interface) synthesizer. SAPI 5 is a Microsoft Windows speech recognition and synthesis platform. It is used by many applications, including Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Internet Explorer.The sapi5 argument specifies that the SAPI 5 synthesizer should be used. An example is code snippet in the program "engine = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')"


2. **sys**: This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter. It's commonly used for system-specific parameters and functions.

3. **os**: This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. It's used for interacting with the operating system, such as working with files, directories, and processes.

4. **re**: The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match of a regular expression pattern.

5. **threading**: The threading module provides a way to run multiple threads simultaneously. Threads are used to achieve multitasking in programs.

6. **tkinter**: Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. It provides various widgets to build GUI applications.

7. **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: The PIL module adds image processing capabilities to Python. It's used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

8. **speech_recognition**: This library provides support for performing speech recognition in Python. It allows Python to interact with various speech recognition engines and APIs.

9. **requests**: The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. It's commonly used for interacting with web services and APIs.

10. **winsound**: This module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. It's used for playing sound alerts.

11. **pyttsx3**: This library is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. It's used to convert text into speech.

12. **difflib**: The difflib module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences. It's used for comparing strings and finding similarities.

13. **shutil**: The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It's used for file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting files.
